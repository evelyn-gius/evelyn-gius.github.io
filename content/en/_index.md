    ImagePath="../images/evelyngius.png"
    Description="I am professor of Digital Philology and Modern German Literary Studies at the Department of Linguistics and Literary Studies at the Technical University of Darmstadt. I run the [fortext lab](https://fortext.org), which conducts research in the field of Digital Humanities with a special interest in Computational Literary Studies and Computational Narratology. Moreover, I am the chair of the *Association for Digital Humanities in the German-Speaking Area* ([DHd](https://dig-hum.de)) and a co-editor of the diamond open-access journal [*Journal of Computational Literary Studies*](https://jcls.io) (JCLS) as well as the German and English book series [*Digitale Literaturwissenschaft*](https://www.springer.com/series/16777) (Metzler) as well as the German diamond open-access journal [*forTEXT Hefte*](https://www.fortext-hefte.de/)." >}}

### Research Interests

My research interest lies in manual annotation, narratological analysis, and particularly in the segmentation of texts, methodological questions of automation and the automatability of literary text analysis, as well as the operationalization of approaches from the humanities.

In addition to our work in research projects, I provide two established services to numerous users in the Digital Humanities with my lab: the collaborative annotation software [CATMA](https://catme.de/), developed since 2008, and the [fortext.net](https://fortext.net) portal (in German), which offers a low-threshold introduction to methods and tools of the Digital Humanities.
